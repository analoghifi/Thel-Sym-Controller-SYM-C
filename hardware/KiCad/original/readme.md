this is not the original Thel PCB but it's very like\* the original with the following exceptions:  
* slightly different board dimensions original: 47mm x 80mm -> this PCB: 47mm x 81mm
* sightly different mounting hole spacing original: 40mm x 73mm -> this PCB: 40mm x 74mm
* more massive ground and power supply PCB tracks  
* using the 2mm gold-plated brass solder pins (the same ones used on the more expensive Thel modules)
* different arrangement of the two GND output pins
* using a combined 5.0mm/7.5mm pin spacing footprint for the foil caps (C3,C8)  
* using a combined 2.5mm/5.0mm pin spacing footprint for the small ceramic caps (C1,C2,C6,C7)  
* 
  
\*(same schematic / same 1-layer\** layout THT / same THT components in the same places on the board)  
\**(strictly speaking, this KiCad PCB is a two-layer PCB with plated-through holes, but you can also (let) produce it as a classic 1-layer PCB with non-plated holes if you wish, since all the tracks are on the bottom side only)
